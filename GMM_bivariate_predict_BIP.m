% First, fit bivariate model to all substudies, except study of interest (e.g., TOP)
% Then, apply predictor to individual subjects in study of interest (e.g., TOP), using different # of (randomly?) pruned SNPs
% BIP: TOP7: 24 of 32, TOP8: 25 of 32
% SCZ: TOP7: 24 of 32, TOP8: 25 of 32
% Need to read in phenotypes and genotypes of subjects in study of interest (in /space/syn03/1/data/GWAS/processed_genotype/BIP_TOP -- need permission from yunpeng)
